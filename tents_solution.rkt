; HELPER FUNCTIONS

;This function takes 2 parameters. 
;First parameter will be a function and the second parameter will be a list. 
;This function would apply the given function to each element of the list in order. 
;If the given function returns something that is not false, 
;then this function should return the return value as well. 
;If the given func- tion returns false for each and every element of the list 
;then this function should return false as well.

;This function takes 2 parameters. 
;Both parameters will be lists with 2 integers representing a position on a grid. 
;This function should return true if these positions are adjacent, including diago- nals, or the same position. 
;Otherwise it should return false.

;This function takes a single parameter. 
;It will be a list with 2 integers representing a position on a grid. 
;This function should return a list of neighboring positions, horizontally and vertically. 
;The function can return the neighbors in any order. 
;Even if a position is out of bounds in the context of the tents puzzle this function must put that position in the list that this function returns.

;This function takes 2 parameters. 
;A list containing 2 integers and a list of lists that are containing 2 integers.
;The first parameter represents a position on a grid and each element on the second list also represents a position.

;by the first parameter is adjacent to at least one of the positions in the given list (using the same definition for adjacency from the ADJACENT function). 
;Otherwise it should return false
